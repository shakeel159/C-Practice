# C-Practice
Proof of my understanding of C++ and basic programming patterns


HOW TO OPEN AND RUN PROJECT:
open Visual Studio and open the folder holding the main.cpp file.
here you can view my code which corresponds to the folders name and purpose of code.
to run code open new terminal again track the folder where the c++ project is located and run these commands:
- g++ main.cpp -o main
and then.
- ./main

the terminal will print the results of whatever the code wants to print but the focus is on the code and my understanding of
programming strategies encapsulation, polymorphism, and Abstraction in C++.
 
**Abstraction:**.
taking a base class such as bank that holds all variables and methods that all banks require which then specified banks can abstract those.
variables and methods when needed or modify or create more methods.
**Encapsulation:**.
Taking control of what data users have access too by limiting variables to be modified outside the program.
**Polymorphism:**.
taking base class I can implement different classes to act similarly by using the same methods and variables but performing different logic.
